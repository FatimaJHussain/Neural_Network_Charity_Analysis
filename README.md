## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to create a binary classifier using neural networks. This classifier is expected to be capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business data includes more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns capturing metadata about each organization. We will use this metadata and neural networks to predict the success rate of organizations.
